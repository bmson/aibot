/**
 * Honesty check for the tool-less streaming chat path. The executor runs
 * enforceResponseContract before publishing; this path streams straight to the
 * client, so by the time the full draft exists the text has already been seen.
 *
 * The contract owns the durable answer: a flagged draft persists as the
 * replacement, and the caller streams that same replacement to the client so
 * the live reply and the stored one never disagree. An `off-course` marker
 * rides alongside it, and the chat renders a compact card offering to rerun
 * the request through the real executor.
 *
 * `urlCorpus` is the caller's to supply, and omitting it skips the link rule
 * entirely. This path's tool ledger is NOT a usable corpus on its own: it
 * holds no owner turns, so a link the owner pasted themselves — or one the
 * model wrote from its own knowledge in a turn that ran no tools at all —
 * reads as fabricated and is stripped out of an otherwise fine reply.
