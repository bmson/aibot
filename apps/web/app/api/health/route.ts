 * Release verification target: reports the commit baked into this image.
 *
 * infra/gcp/release.sh polls this after rolling the web service and fails the
 * release unless it reports the tag being released. That check is the only
 * thing separating "the web image was built and pushed" from "production is
 * actually serving it" — without it a stranded rollout is invisible until
 * someone notices their UI change never appeared.
 *
 * Deliberately unauthenticated: the verifier runs in GitHub Actions with no
 * owner session, and a commit SHA is not a secret. It reveals nothing about
 * the owner's data, so it stays outside isAuthed() on purpose.
