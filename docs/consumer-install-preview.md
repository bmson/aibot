# Offline consumer installation preview

For a guided local artifact setup from explicit target and owner details, start with [consumer preparation](consumer-prepare.md). It writes a validated manifest and a private, deliberately incomplete runtime-seed template after verifying the exact local archive digest; it does not contact Google Cloud.

`pnpm install:plan --input install-input.json` validates a proposed installation and prints JSON. It needs no Google sign-in, runtime environment file, database credentials, or model API key. It does not call a provisioner, enable APIs, create resources, or write a manifest to disk. `pnpm install:plan --help` shows usage.

This is a developer preview, not the finished single-click installer. The response always contains `mode: "preview-only"` and `runtimeGated: true`, plus the remaining implementation and live-validation gates.

The response also contains `databaseCreationIntent`, which identifies the selected database and records a create-only, no-adoption intent. Its `absenceVerification.requiredBeforeProvisioning` value is `true` while `performed` remains `false`: a future authenticated provisioner must verify that the selected database is absent before attempting creation. This applies equally to `(default)` and named databases.

## Input

Provide these fields in a local JSON file:

- `identity`: `installationId`, `projectId`, `region`, `databaseId`, and `release` containing `commitSha` (40 hexadecimal characters) and `archiveDigest` (`sha256:` plus 64 hexadecimal characters).
- `modules`: module names from the repository registry; `[]` selects no optional modules.
- `modelProvider`: `google` or `openrouter`.
- `resources`: recorded resource declarations; use `[]` for a new preview.
- `createdAt`: an ISO UTC timestamp, such as `2026-09-12T00:00:00.000Z`.
- Optional `embeddingModel` and `embeddingDimension` record the planned embedding space. They do not verify model availability or migrate existing vectors.

Use `(default)` for a new eligible project or a valid named database (4–63 characters), an installation ID of 4–21 characters, and a standard Google region. A future creator must verify that `(default)` is absent before creating it and must never adopt an existing database; this offline preview performs neither check. UUID-like database IDs remain rejected.

Use the exact source archive's digest and its full release commit. Validation checks syntax and identity consistency; it does not establish the source archive's authenticity or verify its contents against a remote release. Do not include credentials or environment variables. Unknown fields are rejected.

For machine-readable output without pnpm's command heading:

```sh
pnpm --silent install:plan --input install-input.json > install-preview.json
```

The command does not create `install-input.json`. A caller must deliberately create that file from the intended installation choices. Reusing an identical input produces identical output.

## Local state and archive verification

The preview remains read-only. An explicit local-state command can persist a validated preview manifest after checking the selected source archive:

```sh
node --input-type=module -e "import fs from 'node:fs'; const preview = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('install-preview.json', 'utf8')); fs.writeFileSync('install-manifest.json', JSON.stringify(preview.manifest, null, 2));"
pnpm install:state --write --state .assistant-install/manifest.json \
  --manifest install-manifest.json --archive assistant-source.tar.gz
```

The archive is streamed for SHA-256 verification against `identity.release.archiveDigest`; it is never extracted or executed. The digest binds the bytes in the local regular file at verification time and does not prove Git provenance or prevent a later file replacement. The state file is written through a same-directory temporary file, fsynced, and atomically renamed. Directory fsync is best effort on supported filesystems, so this does not guarantee persistence across every power-loss scenario. A lock and expected-previous-manifest comparison prevent concurrent or stale overwrites. A leftover lock fails closed; after confirming no writer is active, remove the `.lock` file manually and retry. Use `--expected PATH` for a compare-and-swap retry with the same immutable identity and selection; preview reconfiguration has no implicit overwrite path.

Resume is an explicit read operation:

```sh
pnpm install:state --resume --state .assistant-install/manifest.json \
  --input install-input.json
```

Resume checks the immutable identity and selected modules/provider/embedding settings. It does not advance stages, call Google Cloud, execute source, or claim that a commit hash proves provenance. Cloud stages remain unverified until a future orchestrator performs and records them.

## Manifest and resume behavior

The versioned manifest records the target identity, selected modules/provider, resource declarations, and an ordered stage prefix. The pure `advanceInstallationStage` and `resumeInstallation` helpers support idempotent stage retries and invalidate a resume when the expected immutable identity changes. These helpers are data transformations; they do not authorize a Google account, execute stages, or prove that a stage ran successfully. A future orchestrator must record a completed stage only after verifying its real result.

Resources declare an owner of `bootstrap`, `terraform`, or `preexisting`. Installation-owned resources must match the installation identity; preexisting resources require a null installation ID. Duplicate physical resource identities and foreign-project ownership claims are rejected. These declarations are not proof of cloud ownership. Provisioning and uninstall must additionally verify actual resource names, labels, and state before adopting or deleting anything. Existing/default resources must not be silently adopted or removed.

The preview derives optional workers, API intent, scheduler declarations, and module billing metadata from the existing module registry. Base Google APIs are reported separately. This is an intended configuration, not a cloud readiness check, a priced quote, or a guarantee that an installation can run yet. Terraform/bootstrap execution, the remaining Firestore application adapters, Google model configuration, owner authentication, and live IAM/index/model validation are separate gates.

## Authenticated foundation provisioning

`consumer:install` builds the customer-owned infrastructure foundation. Supplying both `--images` and `--runtime-config` also opts in to the minimal Cloud Run web and agent profile after the foundation is provisioned. It still reports `runtimeReady: false`: a ready Cloud Run revision does not prove owner sign-in, a model response, or complete onboarding.

Before any cloud change, the command checks that the selected customer project has an active Cloud Billing account using the signed-in gcloud identity. A disabled or unverifiable billing association stops the installation with a specific prerequisite error; no billing account identifier is printed. Link billing in the customer's Google Cloud console or grant the operator access to view the project's billing state, then retry the same command. The check runs again when resuming an installation. Billing being enabled does not imply a zero-cost installation: Firestore PITR, Cloud Run's continuously allocated agent CPU, storage, and model calls can incur charges on the customer's account.

Before a later runtime stage starts containers, `pnpm firestore:runtime-data-preflight` can read the selected installation's configured owner agent, budget policy, and eight model roles/catalog entries. It requires explicit `GCP_PROJECT`, `ASSISTANT_WORKSPACE_ID`, `FIRESTORE_DATABASE_ID`, `FIRESTORE_AGENT_ID`, `FIRESTORE_EMBEDDING_SPACE`, and `LLM_PROVIDER` environment values. For a local rehearsal where gcloud login works but Application Default Credentials are unavailable, pass `--gcloud-auth`; this uses the active gcloud account in memory and leaves ADC as the default. A rehearsal database can be selected with `--database-id NAME`, which overrides `FIRESTORE_DATABASE_ID`. The JSON result identifies missing or inconsistent records without printing owner content; a non-ready result exits nonzero. This is a read-only data check, not an authenticated model call, IAM test, or readiness claim.

For a fresh installation, the [minimal runtime seed](consumer-runtime-seed.md) can create this data from an explicit customer plan. Pass `--seed-plan /private/path/runtime-seed.json` to `consumer:install` to run it after the foundation and before the optional Cloud Run runtime stage. The same create-only seed remains available as a standalone command. It does not mark the runtime ready.

Use Node/pnpm, gcloud credentials for the target project, and Terraform 1.6.0 or newer (the checked CI toolchain is 1.14.5). Terraform accepts either ADC or the short-lived `GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable from the active gcloud login; see the [runtime seed guide](consumer-runtime-seed.md) for a token-safe invocation. An apply checks the Terraform version before it creates customer resources; the offline preview does not require Terraform. The target project must have billing available. Generate a canonical source archive from the selected release checkout:

```sh
git archive --format=tar.gz --output=assistant-source.tar.gz HEAD
shasum -a 256 assistant-source.tar.gz
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Put that full SHA and digest into the installation input, then generate the preview and manifest using the commands above. The provisioner checks the digest and compares the five consumer Terraform foundation files against the trusted checkout. It rejects archive path overrides and links and executes only those verified files in an isolated directory. Archives with a top-level repository prefix are unsupported; use the canonical archive command above. Source hashing binds local bytes and does not independently authenticate the release publisher.

From the matching repository root, preview the cloud foundation:

```sh
pnpm consumer:install --manifest install-manifest.json \
  --archive assistant-source.tar.gz --state .assistant-install/manifest.json \
  --state-bucket YOUR_PROJECT-YOUR_INSTALLATION-state \
  --terraform-dir infra/gcp/consumer/terraform
```

The preview performs read-only cloud checks and reports missing APIs. Add `--apply` to enable required APIs, create the private state bucket, upload the release receipt, and apply the foundation, including Firestore indexes and single-field exemptions. The installer verifies `firestore-indexes.tf` and its shared JSON specification against the selected archive and trusted checkout, then copies both into the isolated Terraform workspace at their original relative paths. Resources and Terraform state stay in the selected customer's project. It refuses adoption of an existing selected Firestore database and requires a matching receipt, project number, region, and enforced access protection before reusing a bootstrap bucket. The backend bucket and receipt are recorded in the installation inventory.

To include the seed, add `--seed-plan` to both preview and apply commands. When ADC is unavailable, add `--gcloud-auth` for the Firestore seed and provide a fresh `GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` for Terraform. The gcloud-auth option obtains a short-lived OAuth token from the active gcloud CLI in memory for Firestore; ADC remains the default. The Terraform token is supplied through the environment and is not printed or written by the installer; it expires, so obtain a fresh value before retrying if needed. The plan's project, installation, Google provider, and embedding model and dimensions must match the installation manifest; supply `embeddingModel` and `embeddingDimension` when creating that manifest. If `--runtime-config` is also supplied, its agent ID, owner email, and full embedding space must match the seed plan. The preview validates these inputs without creating seed records. Apply provisions the foundation, runs the create-only seed, then deploys the optional runtime. The seed creates a $0.50 default task cap alongside the daily and monthly policy; the owner can change it on the Costs page. A failed seed leaves the saved foundation stage intact; rerunning the identical plan resumes only its own marker and refuses foreign records. An initialized runtime can only be retried with its existing seed marker. Keep the seed plan private: it contains the owner email and explicitly verified model prices, which the installer does not print.

Repeat the identical command to resume from persisted stages. Terraform state is remote and the last local completed stage is updated atomically. If creation of the state bucket succeeds but upload of its ownership receipt fails, the next run stops for manual ownership verification; it must not automatically adopt that unverified bucket. Failed Terraform work directories are retained for recovery. Terraform creates Firestore composite indexes and field exemptions without waiting for their long-running updates, which can outlast a short-lived gcloud OAuth token. Terraform ignores Firestore's implicit `__name__` field ordering on index refresh; a changed checked-in index definition gets a new resource key, and the independent live verifier remains authoritative. After Terraform apply, the installer reads the selected database's composite indexes and explicit field exemptions through the authenticated `gcloud` CLI. It compares their definitions with the verified archive manifest and waits up to 30 minutes for matching composite indexes to become `READY` before recording `provisioned`. A `CREATING` index is polled every 10 seconds; malformed, missing, extra, foreign-scoped, or failed indexes stop immediately. Timeout leaves the new install at `bootstrapped` for an explicit retry, without changing cloud resources during verification. A resumed `provisioned` install is rechecked and fails closed if its indexes have drifted, without another foundation Terraform apply. An archive from before index packaging fails the trusted-file check and requires an explicit recovery decision.

The foundation apply uses one Terraform operation at a time because concurrent Firestore field-exemption creates against the same database can fail with a transient 409 contention error. The saved remote state lets the same install command resume after any interrupted apply.

### Passkey runtime (no Google OAuth client)

New installations should use [owner passkeys](consumer-owner-passkeys.md). Add `"ownerAuth": "passkey"` to the runtime config and omit `webAuthUrl`, `authSecretVersion`, and both Google client versions:

```json
{
  "firestoreAgentId": "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111",
  "firestoreEmbeddingSpace": { "provider": "vertex", "model": "gemini-embedding-001", "dimensions": 1536, "revision": "customer-seed-v1" },
  "vertexLocation": "global",
  "ownerEmail": "owner@example.com",
  "ownerAuth": "passkey"
}
```

On the runtime apply the installer then:

1. creates `<installation_id>-auth-secret` (labelled `installation=<id>`, `managed-by=assistant-installer`) if absent and adds one random 48-byte version through a mode-0600 temporary file. The value is never printed, passed to Terraform, or stored in installer state; only the version number is recorded. A resumed run reuses the lowest enabled version, and an existing secret without those labels is refused rather than adopted;
2. uses the deterministic origin `https://<installation_id>-web-<project_number>.<region>.run.app` as `AUTH_URL` and passkey relying party (supply `webAuthUrl` only for a custom domain you already route);
3. deploys web with `OWNER_AUTH_MODE=passkey` and public invocation in the same apply. The agent stays IAM-private. An unclaimed installation cannot be taken over: every owner route needs a session, and `/setup` needs the claim code.

Then issue the one-time owner setup link and open it on the device that should hold the first passkey:

```sh
pnpm consumer:install ... --runtime-config ./runtime-config.json --images ./image-manifest.json \
  --issue-owner-claim --apply
```

The result's `ownerClaim.setupUrl` is printed once (valid 24 hours) and is not written to state. Rerunning replaces an unused link; once an owner exists the step is skipped. For later cloud-owner recovery use `pnpm consumer:owner-claim --recover`. `--owner-access-callback` is rejected for passkey installs because there is no OAuth callback.

## Final verification (`ready`)

After the owner has registered a passkey (or, for Google OAuth installs, signed in) and sent a first chat message, run:

```sh
pnpm consumer:install ... --runtime-config ./runtime-config.json --images ./image-manifest.json --verify
pnpm consumer:install ... --runtime-config ./runtime-config.json --images ./image-manifest.json --verify --apply
```

Checks, each reported with a pass/fail detail: both Cloud Run services serve the recorded digests on a ready revision; web is publicly invocable while the agent has no public invoker; `/api/health` on the service URL and the owner origin reports the installation's release commit; the owner is claimed (`/api/owner/status`), or `--owner-signed-in` is passed for Google OAuth installs; the Firestore runtime data preflight passes; and at least one completed model call is recorded, proving an authenticated Vertex response through the service identity. Without `--apply` nothing changes; with `--apply` a full pass advances the installation to `ready` and reports `runtimeReady: true`. A failed check leaves the stage at `initialized` and exits with status 2. `--gcloud-auth` is accepted for the Firestore reads.

For the optional runtime, create three enabled, numbered owner-auth Secret Manager versions and configure the owner Google OAuth client for the intended HTTPS origin. For native iOS access, also create an enabled, numbered `<installation_id>-mobile-api-token` version in the same customer project. Then supply a JSON runtime config containing these fields (omit `mobileApiTokenVersion` if native access is not being configured):

```json
{
  "firestoreAgentId": "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111",
  "firestoreEmbeddingSpace": {
    "provider": "vertex",
    "model": "gemini-embedding-001",
    "dimensions": 1536,
    "revision": "customer-seed-v1"
  },
  "vertexLocation": "global",
  "ownerEmail": "owner@example.com",
  "webAuthUrl": "https://assistant.example.com",
  "authSecretVersion": 1,
  "googleClientIdVersion": 1,
  "googleClientSecretVersion": 1,
  "mobileApiTokenVersion": 1
}
```

Set `vertexLocation` to a location where the selected Google models are available. It defaults to the Cloud Run region when omitted. Current global-only models need `"global"`; Cloud Run, Firestore, and storage remain in the installation region. The runtime checks the configured Vertex location against the deployed web service before marking the stage initialized.

Create the mobile secret in the customer's Secret Manager console and add a high-entropy token as a secret version. Generate the token locally with a trusted password manager or other cryptographically secure generator; keep its value out of shell arguments, terminal output, Terraform variables, the runtime JSON, installation archives, source control, and chat. Copy only the **version number** into `mobileApiTokenVersion`. The installer checks that exact version is enabled and binds `MOBILE_API_TOKEN` to the web Cloud Run service account only; it never retrieves the payload. Transfer the token itself through a private, trusted password-manager channel to the owner's iPhone, then enter it once in the app's **Connection → Mobile access key** field alongside the configured HTTPS server URL. The app stores it in the device Keychain. The customer must verify an authenticated mobile request after web access is configured; provisioning alone does not establish mobile readiness.

`mobileApiTokenVersion` is optional for new installs, preserving the existing no-mobile runtime profile. An already `initialized` install cannot add or rotate this binding through the current installer: its runtime input fingerprint rejects changed config. That requires a separate, reviewed update path; do not edit the saved checkpoint or Terraform state by hand.

After the foundation reaches `provisioned`, pass `--build-images --runtime-config ./runtime-config.json --apply` to have `consumer:install` build and push both images from the exact manifest commit into the customer-owned Artifact Registry, then deploy the returned immutable digests. This replaces the separate `consumer:publish-images` command and image manifest. The installer requires `HEAD` to match the manifest commit and the tracked checkout to be clean; the publisher independently archives that exact SHA. Docker Buildx and an active customer `gcloud auth login` are required. The publisher configures Docker's gcloud credential helper for only the selected regional registry in a private temporary `DOCKER_CONFIG`, uses it for the build and digest checks, and removes it afterward; it does not change the customer's normal Docker configuration. Without `--apply`, the installer only validates the image build plan and current foundation; it does not call Docker or publish images. The installer verifies the two immutable image references and each supplied secret version before applying the runtime profile with the same customer state backend. It checks both Cloud Run services have a ready revision using the expected digest before recording `initialized`. Failed checks leave `provisioned`; if an image push partially succeeds, inspect the customer registry before retrying because its tags are immutable. An initialized checkpoint records an input fingerprint and refuses a changed image or runtime config on resume. No secret value is read, passed to Terraform, written to state, or printed. The runtime remains private by default; owner OAuth, public access, and a real authenticated conversation require separate verification before a `ready` claim.

To make the initialized web service reachable for owner sign-in, finish the customer-owned Google Auth Platform setup first. In **Google Auth Platform → Clients**, create a **Web application** client in the same customer project, configure its consent screen and owner/test-user access, and add the exact authorized redirect URI `https://assistant.example.com/api/auth/callback/google` (substitute the `webAuthUrl` origin). Store its client ID and secret in the numbered `<installation_id>-google-client-id` and `<installation_id>-google-client-secret` Secret Manager versions referenced by the unchanged runtime config. Route the configured HTTPS origin to the deployed web service and verify the certificate and host routing; the installer reports the service's `run.app` URL so the customer can establish the mapping. This OAuth client and domain setup is a customer console step, not a single-click installer action. Google requires an [exact redirect URI match](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server), and its [Web client setup](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials) is performed in Google Auth Platform.

Resume the same install command with `--owner-access-callback https://assistant.example.com/api/auth/callback/google`. Without `--apply`, this is a read-only preview: it verifies the matching initialized runtime, enabled numbered secret versions, web URL, owner auth environment, and service IAM, and returns the URL/callback handoff. After checking the OAuth client configuration and HTTPS routing, add `--apply`; the installer reapplies the verified customer Terraform archive with `allow_public_web_invoker=true`, grants `allUsers` Cloud Run invocation to **web only**, and checks that the agent has no service-level public invoker binding. The agent's own Cloud Run IAM check stays enabled. This follows Google's [service-specific public invoker binding](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/authenticating/public) and [IAM policy inspection](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/managing-access). Audit inherited project-level grants separately. The step is safe to retry, never reads secret payloads, keeps the installation at `initialized`, and continues to report `runtimeReady: false` until owner sign-in and an authenticated chat/model response are verified.

## Update, rollback, and uninstall

**Update or roll back** to another release with `pnpm consumer:update --state STATE --state-bucket BUCKET --archive NEW.tar.gz --commit-sha SHA [--apply]`, run from a clean checkout of that exact commit. It verifies the archive digest, uploads the release receipt to the customer state bucket, writes `install-manifest-<sha>.json` beside the state, and moves the installation back to `bootstrapped` through the reviewed `release-rebase` state transition (only the release may change; bootstrap-owned records such as the generated auth secret are kept). The printed next commands reapply the foundation and indexes, build and deploy the new images, and rerun `--verify --apply`; the installation is not `ready` again until verification passes. For a rollback, deploy the earlier release with `--images image-manifest-<old sha>.json` instead of `--build-images` (registry tags are immutable). Firestore PITR keeps seven days of history for data recovery; there is no automatic data-schema downgrade, so keep the previous release compatible for the rollback window.

**Uninstall** with `pnpm consumer:uninstall --state STATE --state-bucket BUCKET [--apply]`. It works from the recorded inventory and installer names only, in this order: the Scheduler sweep and Cloud Tasks queue, both Cloud Run services, the runtime service accounts and their project grants, and installer-generated secrets. By default the Firestore database, buckets, image repository, and state bucket are kept and listed with their ongoing charges. `--delete-data --confirm-installation ID` also deletes the image repository, the database (after disabling delete protection), and the assets/source buckets; `--delete-state` then deletes the state bucket. Already-deleted resources count as done, so a failed run resumes. The project, enabled APIs, and customer-created secrets are never deleted. Export first if the data should outlive the installation (`pnpm exec tsx scripts/firestore-managed-backup.ts --backup ... --execute` writes a checksummed PITR-consistent export to a bucket you keep; see the [pilot runbook](consumer-fresh-account-pilot.md#8-backup-restore-and-export)); existing managed backups keep billing until they expire.
