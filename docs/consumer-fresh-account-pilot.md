# Fresh-account pilot runbook

This runbook is the owner-executed acceptance test for the customer-owned installation (plan phase P11). It installs the assistant into a **new Google account and a new project**, using that customer's own Firestore, Cloud Run, Vertex AI, Secret Manager, and billing, with no publisher-owned service, credential, OAuth client, or database. Every step can be repeated. Record the evidence table at the end.

The repository tests cover this flow with mocked Terraform providers, a fake `gcloud` runner, and the Firestore emulator. **None of it has run against a real fresh account yet.** Real Google Cloud behaviour is established only by working through this runbook.

## 0. What you need

| Item | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| A new Google account | Use a personal account that has never owned a Cloud project, so the pilot proves the first-run path. |
| A payment method | Google requires a billing account. Creating one is a Google-controlled step, and its time is measured separately. |
| A shell with `gcloud`, Node.js 22+, pnpm 10+, Terraform ≥ 1.6 (CI uses 1.14.5), and Docker with Buildx | Cloud Shell has all of these except possibly a recent pnpm (`corepack enable`). A local machine also works. The "Open in Cloud Shell" button has **not** been proven (plan P0), so start Cloud Shell yourself and clone the repository. |
| A device that supports passkeys | Any current iPhone, Mac, Android phone, or Windows Hello machine. A second device or a hardware key is needed to test the second passkey. |
| About 60–90 minutes | Most of it is waiting on image builds and Firestore index builds. |

Keep one terminal open for the whole run. Closing it at any point is allowed: rerun the same command and it resumes from the persisted stage. Testing that deliberately is step 11.

Throughout, `$DIR` is the private preparation directory printed by step 3, and `$ARGS` is the common argument list:

```sh
ARGS="--manifest $DIR/install-manifest.json --archive $PWD/../assistant-source.tar.gz \
  --state $DIR/installation-state.json --state-bucket $PROJECT-$INSTALL-state \
  --terraform-dir infra/gcp/consumer/terraform"
```

## 1. Create the project (customer console)

1. Sign in to <https://console.cloud.google.com> with the new account and accept the Cloud terms.
2. Create a project, for example `pilot-assistant-1234`. Note the **project ID**.
3. **Billing → Link a billing account.** Create the billing account if prompted.
4. Record: time from first sign-in to billing linked (`t_billing`).

In the shell:

```sh
gcloud auth login                     # the new account
gcloud auth application-default login # optional; otherwise pass --gcloud-auth below
gcloud config set project $PROJECT
export PROJECT=pilot-assistant-1234 REGION=us-central1 INSTALL=pilot
```

Choose a region where Cloud Run, Firestore, and the Vertex models you select are all available. The Firestore location is permanent.

## 2. Pin the release

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bmson/aibot.git assistant && cd assistant
git checkout <RELEASE_COMMIT>          # an exact 40-character SHA, never a branch
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
git archive --format=tar.gz --output=../assistant-source.tar.gz HEAD
shasum -a 256 ../assistant-source.tar.gz   # the release digest
```

## 3. Prepare private inputs (no cloud access)

```sh
pnpm consumer:prepare --project-id $PROJECT --region $REGION --installation-id $INSTALL \
  --owner-name 'Pilot Owner' --owner-email owner@example.com --timezone Europe/London \
  --embedding-model gemini-embedding-001 --embedding-dimension 1536 \
  --archive ../assistant-source.tar.gz --commit-sha $(git rev-parse HEAD) \
  --archive-sha256 <DIGEST>
```

It prints `$DIR` (`.assistant-install/$INSTALL/`, mode 0700). The database is `assistant-$INSTALL`. See [consumer preparation](consumer-prepare.md).

**Complete the seed plan.** Copy `seed-plan.template.json` to `seed-plan.json`. Then fill in the budget, a model catalog, and the eight role assignments, using **current** Vertex prices and availability for your location (see [runtime seed](consumer-runtime-seed.md)). This is the one step that needs judgement: the installer never guesses prices. Check it offline:

```sh
pnpm consumer:seed-runtime --input $DIR/seed-plan.json
```

**Write the passkey runtime config** as `$DIR/runtime-config.json`. It holds no secrets, Google OAuth client, or domain:

```json
{
  "firestoreAgentId": "<agent.id from seed-plan.json>",
  "firestoreEmbeddingSpace": { "provider": "vertex", "model": "gemini-embedding-001", "dimensions": 1536, "revision": "customer-seed-v1" },
  "vertexLocation": "global",
  "ownerEmail": "owner@example.com",
  "ownerAuth": "passkey"
}
```

## 4. Provision the foundation and seed

```sh
pnpm consumer:install $ARGS --seed-plan $DIR/seed-plan.json            # read-only preview
GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN="$(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
  pnpm consumer:install $ARGS --seed-plan $DIR/seed-plan.json --apply  # add --gcloud-auth without ADC
```

Expected: billing check passes; missing APIs are enabled; the state bucket and release receipt are created; Terraform creates Firestore, indexes, buckets, Artifact Registry, and the runtime identity; the installer waits until every index is `READY` (up to 30 minutes); the seed reports `seeded`; the stage is `provisioned`.

If the access token expires during a long index build, get a new token and rerun the same command.

## 5. Build images and deploy the runtime

```sh
pnpm consumer:install $ARGS --runtime-config $DIR/runtime-config.json --build-images            # plan
pnpm consumer:install $ARGS --runtime-config $DIR/runtime-config.json --build-images --apply
```

Expected:
- Both images are built from the exact commit and pushed by digest to the customer's registry. The digests are saved as `$DIR/image-manifest-<sha>.json`.
- `<install>-auth-secret` is created with one generated version; the value is never printed.
- Web (`OWNER_AUTH_MODE=passkey`) and agent are deployed. Web is public; the agent is IAM-private.
- The stage is `initialized`, and `ownerAccess.authOrigin` is `https://$INSTALL-web-<project number>.$REGION.run.app`.

From here on, `$RUNTIME` stands for `--images $DIR/image-manifest-<sha>.json --runtime-config $DIR/runtime-config.json`.

## 6. Claim the installation (owner)

```sh
pnpm consumer:install $ARGS $RUNTIME --issue-owner-claim --apply
```

1. Copy `ownerClaim.setupUrl`. It works once and expires after 24 hours. Open it on the device that will hold the first passkey.
2. Select **Create passkey** and approve with Face ID, Touch ID, or the screen lock.
3. **Save the recovery code** somewhere offline. The page shows it only once.
4. You land in chat, signed in. Record `t_claim` (from `--apply` in step 4 until now, hands-on time only).

Negative checks:
- Open the same link again. Expect "invalid, expired, or already used".
- Open `/chat` in a private window. Expect a redirect to `/signin`.
- Open `/api/auth/signin`. Expect 404.

## 7. First conversation and final verification

1. Send a message such as "Hi, what can you do?" and wait for a reply. The reply comes from Vertex through the service identity; no API key is involved.
2. Verify:

```sh
pnpm consumer:install $ARGS $RUNTIME --verify          # report only
pnpm consumer:install $ARGS $RUNTIME --verify --apply  # records "ready" when every check passes
```

Expected checks, all `ok: true`:
- `cloud-run-revisions`
- `owner-access`
- `health <run.app URL>` (serves the release commit)
- `owner-claimed`
- `runtime-data`
- `model-response`

The result then shows `runtimeReady: true` and stage `ready`. A failing check leaves the stage at `initialized`, exits with status 2, and names what to fix.

## 8. Acceptance checks

Mark each as pass or fail in the evidence table.

| Check | How |
| --- | --- |
| Second passkey | **/security → Add a passkey** on another device or a hardware key. Sign out, then sign in with it. |
| Sign out everywhere | **/security → Sign out everywhere**. Other browsers are signed out within about 10 seconds. |
| Offline recovery | In a private window, open **/signin → Lost your passkey?**, enter the recovery code, and create a passkey. A new recovery code is shown, and the old one no longer works. |
| Cloud-owner recovery | `pnpm consumer:owner-claim --project $PROJECT --installation $INSTALL --database assistant-$INSTALL --url <authOrigin> --recover --apply`. Open the link and register a passkey. Every other session is signed out. |
| Last passkey guard | Remove passkeys until one is left. The last one cannot be removed. |
| iPhone | **/security → Create device key**, then enter the server URL and key in the app's **Connection** screen. Load chat. Revoke the key and confirm the app gets 401 within about 30 seconds. |
| Memory | Tell the assistant a fact, then ask about it in a new chat. |
| Idle cost | Leave the installation idle for 24 hours, then read **Billing → Reports**, filtered to the project. |
| No publisher dependency | In the Cloud Run revision environment, check there is no `DATABASE_URL` and no `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and that no secret references a publisher project. |

## 9. Backup, restore, and export

PITR is always on and keeps 7 days of history. For a consistent export into a bucket you keep:

```sh
pnpm exec tsx scripts/firestore-managed-backup.ts --backup --project-id $PROJECT \
  --database-id assistant-$INSTALL --installation-id $INSTALL \
  --gcs-prefix gs://$PROJECT-$INSTALL-assets/exports/pilot-1 \
  --snapshot-time <an ISO minute within the last hour> --manifest $DIR/backup-1.json --execute
```

Then rehearse a restore into a **new** database and compare checksums:

```sh
pnpm exec tsx scripts/firestore-managed-backup.ts --restore --project-id $PROJECT \
  --database-id assistant-$INSTALL-restore1 --installation-id $INSTALL \
  --location $REGION --manifest $DIR/backup-1.json --execute
```

If the export fails with a permission error, grant the project's Firestore service agent (`service-<project number>@gcp-sa-firestore.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) write access to that bucket, then retry. Expect the restore result's `documents` and `canonicalHash` to match the backup. Then delete the rehearsal database with `gcloud firestore databases delete --database=assistant-$INSTALL-restore1`. Promoting a restored database to serve the installation is **not automated**. It needs a reviewed identity/state change; see the Terraform README section "Managed backups and restore".

## 10. Update and rollback

With a newer release commit checked out and archived as in step 2:

```sh
pnpm consumer:update --state $DIR/installation-state.json --state-bucket $PROJECT-$INSTALL-state \
  --archive ../assistant-source-new.tar.gz --commit-sha <NEW_SHA>           # preview
pnpm consumer:update ... --apply
```

Run the three printed `next` commands in order: foundation, build and deploy, then `--verify --apply`. Chat history, passkeys, and the recovery code must all survive.

To roll back, check out the old commit and run `consumer:update` with the old archive. Then deploy with `--images $DIR/image-manifest-<old sha>.json` instead of `--build-images`.

## 11. Interruption and failure drills

| Drill | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Press Ctrl-C during step 4's Terraform apply, then rerun | Resumes from remote state and reaches `provisioned`. |
| Close the terminal while indexes are building, then rerun | Rechecks the indexes and continues. |
| Rerun steps 4 to 7 after success | Each run is a no-op or re-verification. No duplicate secret versions or resources are created. |
| Let a claim link expire, or issue a second one | The old link fails. `--issue-owner-claim --apply` issues a fresh one while nobody owns the install. |
| Run step 4 against a project whose billing is not linked | Stops before any change, with a billing prerequisite error. |
| Prepare a second installation ID in the same project | Its own database, buckets, and service accounts. No adoption of the first installation's resources. |

## 12. Uninstall

```sh
pnpm consumer:uninstall --state $DIR/installation-state.json --state-bucket $PROJECT-$INSTALL-state          # plan + retained charges
pnpm consumer:uninstall ... --apply                                                                          # stop and remove the runtime
pnpm consumer:uninstall ... --delete-data --confirm-installation $INSTALL --delete-state --apply             # optional: delete everything
```

Afterwards confirm in the console:
- no Cloud Run services, Scheduler jobs, or queues remain;
- no `$INSTALL-*` service accounts remain;
- with `--delete-data`, the database, the buckets (soft-deleted objects are billed for 7 days), and the Artifact Registry repository are gone.

The project itself is never deleted. Delete it yourself, or unlink billing, when the pilot is over.

## Evidence to record

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Release commit / archive digest | |
| Account, project ID, region | |
| `t_billing` (account creation to billing linked) | |
| Provisioning wall time (step 4), including index wait | |
| Image build and deploy wall time (step 5) | |
| Hands-on time from step 3 to first reply (target: under 10 minutes once billing is ready) | |
| Verification result (paste the `checks`) | |
| Acceptance checks, pass/fail each | |
| Drills, pass/fail each | |
| 24-hour idle cost, and a light-use day's cost | |
| Issues or unclear instructions | |

## Known limits in this release

- **Agent idle cost.** The Firestore agent still runs its local poller, so it keeps one always-allocated instance (1 vCPU, 1 GiB). That costs tens of dollars a month at list price even when idle; see [Cloud Run pricing](https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing). The Terraform `task_dispatch = "cloud-tasks"` profile (a scale-to-zero agent with a queue and Scheduler) is ready, but it stays off until the agent accepts `QUEUE_DRIVER=cloudtasks` in Firestore mode.
- **Minimal modules.** The Firestore runtime runs with `ASSISTANT_MODULES=minimal`. Gmail/Calendar (the Workspace wizard), SMS, browser, and code modules are not part of this pilot.
- **iOS pairing.** Device keys are copied manually. There is no QR pairing exchange yet.
- **Cloud Shell entry.** The one-click "Open in Cloud Shell" entry has not been proven. The pilot starts from a manual clone.
- **Restore promotion.** Restoring into a new database is scripted. Switching the live installation to that database is a manual, reviewed change.
- **Model catalog.** The owner must verify prices and availability; the installer does not fetch them.
