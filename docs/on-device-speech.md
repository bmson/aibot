# On-device speech: a talking interface on iPhone

Feasibility study for making the iOS client *speak* its replies — and, later, *listen* — with no
network round trip, no per-word billing, and no new server module.

Status: **Phase 1 shipped** — `Components/SpeakableText.swift` projects a reply for the ear,
`System/SpeechPlayer.swift` reads it, and spoken progress survives the stream-to-durable handoff.
Phases 2 and 3 are as described below.

**Verdict: feasible, and cheaper than it looks.** The Apple side is small. `AVSpeechSynthesizer`
is about a hundred lines and costs nothing. The real work is not synthesis — it is deciding what a
card-heavy transcript *sounds* like, and not saying the same sentence twice across the handoff from
the stream to the durable row.

A naming note first, because the collision is already in the tree: **voice** in this codebase means
the owner's *writing* voice (`apps/web/app/profile/voice/page.tsx`, `voiceProfile`, `voice_samples`)
— the tone the assistant imitates when it drafts on the owner's behalf. Anything audible should be
called **speech**, **spoken replies**, or **talk mode**. Never "voice mode".

## What the platform gives us

The app targets iOS 26 exclusively (`IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 26.0`, set for every target in
`apps/ios/Assistant.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`) and carries no third-party iOS dependencies. That
floor is unusually convenient here: it clears the way to both the mature synthesis API and the new
transcription one, with no availability checks and no fallback path to maintain.

### Speaking — AVFoundation

`AVSpeechSynthesizer` + `AVSpeechUtterance`, from AVFoundation. It is on-device, offline, free,
needs no entitlement, and raises **no permission prompt** — the whole of phase 1 can ship without
asking the owner for anything. The synthesizer holds a queue, so utterances can be enqueued per
sentence as a reply streams in. Its delegate reports `willSpeakRangeOfSpeechString`, which is a word
range in the string being spoken: enough to highlight the sentence in the bubble as it is read, and
enough to drive a mouth on the companion face.

The quality tiers deserve care, because they are the one place where the honest answer is "it
depends on what the owner has downloaded":

- `.default` — always present, heavily compressed, audibly mechanical.
- `.enhanced` and `.premium` — neural, genuinely good, and **not downloadable by us**. The owner
  fetches them in Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content → Voices. An app can enumerate what is
  installed (`AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.speechVoices()`, filtering on `.quality`) but cannot trigger
  the download.
- Siri's own voices are not available to third-party apps at all. Assume they never will be.

So the shipping behaviour is: pick the best installed voice for the locale at runtime, and if only
compact voices exist, say so once — a single dismissible row offering the Settings path — rather
than letting the owner conclude the assistant sounds like a 2011 GPS. Personal Voice
(`AVSpeechSynthesizer.requestPersonalVoiceAuthorization()`) is a later flourish, not a dependency.

The audio session needs a deliberate choice, not a default. `.playback` with mode `.spokenAudio`
and `.duckOthers` is the right one for read-aloud: it lowers music instead of stopping it, and it
resumes cleanly. It also **ignores the silent switch**, which is the correct behaviour for a
deliberate "read this to me" tap and the wrong one for auto-speak — so auto-speak should be off by
default and the setting should say plainly that replies will be audible with the ringer off.
Speaking with the screen locked additionally needs `audio` in `UIBackgroundModes`
(`apps/ios/Assistant/Info.plist:43` already declares that array for `location`).

### Listening — two paths, and a free one

1. **Keyboard dictation.** Zero code. The system mic on the keyboard already types into the
   composer today. If "talking interface" mostly means *not typing*, this is already shipped and
   costs nothing to say so.
2. **`SpeechAnalyzer` + `SpeechTranscriber`** (the Speech framework's iOS 26 API). Fully on-device,
   streaming, with volatile results that firm up as context arrives, real punctuation, and no
   short-utterance ceiling. Model assets are system-managed per locale via `AssetInventory`,
   downloaded once and shared across apps — so the app must handle "asset not yet installed" as a
   first-class state, not an error. Given the iOS 26 floor, this is the path to take.
3. `SFSpeechRecognizer` with `requiresOnDeviceRecognition = true` remains as prior art, but there is
   no reason to choose it here.

Either native path needs `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` and `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription`
in `Info.plist`, and both prompt the owner.

## What is actually hard, in this codebase

### 1. Deciding what to speak

This is the bulk of the work, and it is entirely ours — Apple has no opinion about it.

The transcript is not prose. `packages/core`'s card compiler sends `generated-card` parts, and
`MessageCard.replacesProse` (`apps/ios/Assistant/Components/MessageBubble.swift:1413`) says outright
that a card grounded in a lookup *stands in for* the reply rather than heading it. Feeding
`ChatMessage.text` (`apps/ios/Assistant/Models/APIModels.swift:221`) to a synthesizer therefore
fails in two directions at once: for a card-answered turn there is nothing to say, and for an
ordinary turn it reads Markdown punctuation aloud, recites table pipes, and spells out a fenced code
block character by character.

What it needs is a `SpeakableText` projection — a pure function from parts to a string meant for the
ear:

- Walk `AssistantMarkdown.blocks(in:)` (`MessageBubble.swift:4218`), which already parses headings,
  paragraphs, lists, quotes, tables, equations, and code fences into a typed tree. Speech is just a
  different visitor over the same tree.
- Skip code fences and Mermaid diagrams; say "there's a code block" once rather than reading it.
- Reduce a table to its shape and, at most, its first row — "a table, four rows: Monday, 9am,
  …" — never its pipes.
- Drop link URLs and keep their labels; keep list items as sentences with a pause between them.
- For `replacesProse` cards, speak a projection of the card — its title and the two or three facts
  it was grounded in — because the card *is* the answer.
- Normalise what looks wrong aloud: `AssistantTemperature.localized`
  (`MessageBubble.swift:1587`) already rewrites units; "18°C" should reach the synthesizer as
  "eighteen degrees".

All of this is pure string work with no AVFoundation in sight, which means it is unit-testable in
`apps/ios/AssistantTests` exactly the way `AssistantMarkdownTests.swift` already tests the parser.
That is the single most important structural decision in this plan: **the speakable projection is a
tested pure function, and the synthesizer is a thin protocol-backed shell behind it.**

### 2. Not saying it twice

The turn lifecycle is the one genuine correctness trap.

`AppModel.send` (`apps/ios/Assistant/AppModel.swift:1549`) appends an optimistic assistant row keyed
`stream-<uuid>`, streams deltas into it through `receive(delta:streamID:)`
(`AppModel.swift:1851`), and then `pollForReply` (`AppModel.swift:1877`) reconciles that row against
the durable one the server persisted — removing the `stream-` twin when the real message lands
(`AppModel.swift:2007`). A turn can also be resumed after backgrounding (`resumeInterruptedTurn`,
`AppModel.swift:613`), and a failed socket re-enters through the cursor poll without replaying the
POST.

Anything that speaks must therefore track *spoken progress per turn*, keyed on the stream id and
carried across the swap to the durable id — an offset into the reply, not a set of message ids.
Speak only the suffix past that offset. Get this wrong and the owner hears the last two sentences of
every reply a second time, which is worse than not speaking at all.

The sentence boundary comes almost free: the server already emits `[break]` cues
(`packages/core/src/chat-cues.ts:15`) marking the exact beats where a reply splits into separate
bubbles, and `ChatMessage.textBubbles` (`APIModels.swift:229`) exposes the result. A break is a
paragraph-length pause; sentence ends inside a bubble are ordinary punctuation scanning over the
accumulated delta buffer, holding back any trailing partial sentence until more text arrives.

### 3. Turn-taking, if it is to be hands-free

Half-duplex is easy and full-duplex is a project. Push-to-talk — hold to speak, release to send,
tap anywhere to stop the reply — needs no echo cancellation and no wake word, and covers most of
what "talk to it while cooking" actually means. Listening *while* speaking (barge-in) requires
`.playAndRecord` with voice-processing I/O enabled on the audio engine's input node, or the
recognizer transcribes the synthesizer. Treat that as its own phase, and do not let it block the
first one.

### 4. What speech must not be allowed to do

The platform is built around approval before any outward-facing action, and the iOS client already
demands deliberate confirmation — device unlock for notification actions, an explicit decision in
`ApprovalsView`. **Spoken input must never be able to approve anything.** "Yes" heard across a room
is not consent, and a transcription error there is unrecoverable in a way a mistyped chat message is
not. Talk mode should surface an approval by saying that one is waiting and stopping there.

## What it does *not* need

Worth stating plainly, because it is the strongest part of the case:

- **No server change.** Synthesis is client-side. No new module in `assistant.config.ts`, no
  migration, no env var, nothing in `pnpm config:check`.
- **No cost.** No per-character TTS billing, no key, no quota, and it works on a plane.
- **No privacy surface.** The reply never leaves the phone to be spoken. For a self-hosted personal
  assistant whose pitch is that the owner holds their own data, on-device synthesis is not merely
  adequate — it is the version that matches the product.

The one optional server-side improvement is a talk-mode variant of the persona lines in
`companionPersonaLines()` (`packages/core/src/chat-cues.ts:304`): a reply meant for the ear wants to
be shorter and to avoid tables entirely. That is a refinement to make once the client exists, gated
on a flag in the send payload — not a prerequisite.

There is, pleasingly, already a face. The server emits `data-face` cues and the client decodes them
into `CompanionFace` (`APIModels.swift:531`). A talk-mode screen has its visual vocabulary sitting
there unused, needing no new protocol.

## Project mechanics

- `apps/ios/Assistant.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` is hand-maintained with explicitly assigned UUIDs
  (`C000000000000000000000NN`). Each new Swift file needs a `PBXFileReference`, a `PBXBuildFile`, a
  group entry, and a line in the sources phase — mechanical, but it will not happen by itself.
- AVFoundation and Speech auto-link in Swift; no framework build-phase edits.
- `Info.plist` changes: `audio` added to `UIBackgroundModes` for phase 1's locked-screen playback;
  the two speech/mic usage strings only when listening lands.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ios.yml`) builds and tests on `macos-latest` against a simulator, so it
  will catch compile and unit-test regressions. It cannot catch the ones that matter most: the
  simulator has no enhanced or premium voices and no real mic. Audio quality, ducking against music,
  route changes on AirPods, and the silent switch all need a device pass — which is already how this
  app is QA'd (`apps/ios/docs/visual-qa.md`).

## Suggested phasing

**Phase 1 — Spoken replies.** A play button on an assistant bubble, an auto-speak toggle in
`MoreView` (off by default, alongside the existing `@AppStorage` settings at
`apps/ios/Assistant/Views/MoreView.swift:8`), best-installed-voice selection with the one-time
Settings hint, and the tested `SpeakableText` projection. New files:
`Assistant/System/SpeechPlayer.swift`, `Assistant/Components/SpeakableText.swift`, plus tests.
Roughly one to two days. No server change, no permission prompt, no cost.

**Phase 2 — Voice input.** Document keyboard dictation as the answer that already works, then add
push-to-talk on the composer via `SpeechTranscriber`, including the asset-download state. Two to
three days.

**Phase 3 — Talk mode.** A full-screen hands-free surface built on `CompanionFace`, barge-in with
voice-processing I/O, and a spoken-reply persona variant on the server. About a week, and the only
phase with real unknowns.

Phase 1 is independently shippable and carries the feature's whole first impression. Start there.
